Application deployment and management takes on a complex nature as we step into cloud-native domain. There are numerous challenges blocking developers path such as infrastructure maintenance and monitoring. In this blog post I will be discussing these challenges in detail and I will also be comparing a tool such as [Kestra](https://kestra.io/) offering solution for most of the challenges with other tools out in the market based on certain factors such as architecture, scalibilty, integrations, robustness etc.

## Challenges in Infrastructure Orchestration

There are various challenges faced while orchestrating an infrastructure. Some of the common ones are listed below: 

- **Complex Workflow Orchestration**: Orchestrating infrastructure processes required managing several jobs together with dependencies which is time-consuming and also have chances to generate more errors.
- **Issues in Scalibility**: Scaling the orchestration system as workloads increase becomes more challenging.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Extensive monitoring and logging were necessary to provide insights into workflow execution and identify errors rapidly.
- **Inefficient Use of Developer Time**: Developers spend their most of time to maintain workflows and infrastructure rather than creating and innovating.

## Role of Infrastructure Orchestration in DevOps
In the world of DevOps, infrastructure orchestration plays a crucial role:

1. **Automated Workflows:** It automates complex workflows which enables consistent deployments across multiple environments.
2. **Enhanced Collaboration:** By bridging gaps between operations and development orchestration tools, it promotes a collaborative environment conducive to continuous integration and delivery.
3. **Resource Optimization:** Efficient resource management helps minimize waste and optimize costs.
4. **Error Reduction:** Automation reduces the risk of human error, improving stability and reliability.

## Kestra: A Helping Hand in Workflow Orchestartion

Kestra is a **Unified Orchestration Platform** for scheduling and orchestration that simplifies complicated data pipelines and processes. Kestra gives developers the freedom to concentrate on creativity and execution rather than the complexities of infrastructure administration by providing a complete platform. It offers a user-friendly visual interface for process design, which both technical and non-technical people may efficiently utilize.

Kestra successfully handles typical difficulties in infrastructure orchestration with a range of additional features:

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Kestra's offers a topology feature which provides visual aid to the developers of the Kestra flow implemented. It furthermore helps the other team members to edit the configuration as required using the topology feature.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Kestra was designed to handle large-scale processes easily. Because it supports horizontal scalability, It may expand with your demands, delivering stable performance even under high load.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring Tools**: Kestra provides access to thorough records and monitoring capabilities. These technologies give insights on process progress and performance, allowing for faster identification and resolution of issues, hence ensuring system dependability.
- **Simplified Management**: Kestra combines several management duties into a single platform, easing infrastructure deployment and management. This connection lowers the need for various external tools, simplifying the entire management process.
- **Realtime Triggers**: One of Kestra's most notable features is its support for realtime triggers. This feature enables workflows to be started automatically depending on specific events or situations, guaranteeing fast reactions to significant changes and improving the efficiency of automated procedures.

## Key Features of Kestra

- **Kestra's Terraform Provider**: It helps you to manage and deploy Kestra workflows directly within your existing Terraform environment which eliminates the need for separate configurations.
- **Configuration without Extensive Code**: It helps in saving developers' time and also reduces the need to write long and complex configuration files that helps in overall developer productivity.
- **Quick Deployment**: Make complex deployments and changes in already configured deployments easily with just few clicks.
- **Detailed Insights and User Dashboards**: Overall visibility and information on different observability units of the application along with robust logging workflow.

## Kestra vs Other Tools

### Overview of other Tools

1. **Airflow:** It is a tool backed with python that helps in scheduling and monitoring workflows but may struggle with scalability and ease of use due to its programming restrictions.
2. **Dagster:** It focuses on data asset orchestration within python environments which potentially limit its appeal to non python users.
3. **Prefect:** It is similar to Kestra in its modern approach but remains more python centric, which might restrict its usability outside python friendly teams.
