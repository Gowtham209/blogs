In today's digital landscape, PDFs have become a ubiquitous format, with billions generated annually. Despite their widespread use, traditional PDF tools often lead to inefficiencies, with significant time lost on tasks like customization, integration, and scalability. A study by IDC found that document-related challenges cost organizations nearly 21.3% in lost productivity. With the growing complexity of business processes, having an efficient PDF management solution is crucial.

## Challenges of Traditional Documentation Management Systems

1. **Static Document Creation**:  
   Traditional PDF tools often rely on fixed templates, making it difficult to add dynamic content, such as real-time data or personalized user information, without complex coding.
   
2. **Limited Design Options**:  
   Many PDF generators struggle to produce professional, branded documents, leading to inconsistent appearances across different outputs.
   
3. **Difficult Integration with Existing Systems**:  
   Most PDF tools require substantial custom coding to integrate with existing software, increasing development time and the risk of errors.
   
4. **Scalability and Performance Issues**:  
   As businesses scale, they need tools that can handle larger volumes. Many older solutions falter under the pressure of high document demands, resulting in slow performance.
   
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
   With users accessing documents on various devices, it is essential that PDFs render well on both mobile and desktop platforms. Older tools often fail to provide an optimal user experience on mobile.

## Introducing Fileforge

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d86263-5a98-4b3c-b9c1-91be4e7e0ccb)

Fileforge is a comprehensive API designed to streamline the creation and management of PDF documents. Whether you need to generate PDFs, fill forms, add digital signatures, or handle complex document workflows, Fileforge offers a robust solution. It's also easy to integrate into modern web applications thanks to its open-source React library, react-print.

## Creating a PDF using Fileforge

In this section, I will demonstrate how to create a PDF using Fileforge by compiling a React component and utilizing Tailwind CSS in the code.

### Step 1: Creating an Account on Fileforge

To get started with Fileforge for PDF creation, visit their [documentation](https://docs.fileforge.com/getting-started/general/welcome) for all the available options. Create an account on [Fileforge](https://app.fileforge.com/) to begin using their API services.

### Step 2: Choosing the Project

You can either integrate Fileforge into an existing codebase to perform document operations or write new code to generate documents from scratch. In this example, we'll use the following configuration to create a PDF.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "dotenv/config";
import fs from "fs";
import { FileforgeClient } from '@fileforge/client';
import { compile, Tailwind, Footnote } from "@fileforge/react-print";

const Document = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Tailwind>
        <main className="text-gray-700">
          <h1 className="text-4xl text-gray-800">Hey {name}!</h1>
          <img
            className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
            src="wemakedevs.png"
            alt="WeMakeDevs-Image"
          />
          <p className="my-8">
            This is a PDF to demonstrate the workings of Fileforge.
            <Footnote>Check out the website for more conversions.</Footnote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick links:
            <ul className="my-4 mx-4">
              <li>
                <a
                  className="text-blue-500 underline"
                  href="https://docs.fileforge.com"
                >
                  Documentation
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  className="text-blue-500 underline"
                  href="https://docs.fileforge.com/react-print/welcome/getting-started"
                >
                  React-print: Fileforge's open-source library for designing PDFs with React
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </main>
      </Tailwind>
    </>
  );
};

const ff = new FileforgeClient({
  apiKey: process.env.FILEFORGE_API_KEY,
});

(async () => {
  try {
    const HTML = await compile(<Document name="Folks" />);

    const pdf = await ff.pdf.generate(
      [
        new File([HTML], "index.html", { type: "text/html" }),
        new File([fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/images/wemakedevs.png")], "wemakedevs.png", {
          type: "image/png",  
        })
      ],
      {
        options: {
          host: false,
          test: false,
        },
      }
    );

    pdf.pipe(fs.createWriteStream("WeMakeDevs-Fileforge.pdf"));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during PDF conversion:", error);
  }
})();
```

### Step 3: Creating and Rendering the PDF

Once the configuration is ready, use the command below to create and render the PDF.

```bash
npm run render 
```

Make sure to provide the file path containing the configuration in the `render` section of your project's `package.json`.

### Step 4: Verifying the Content and PDF

You can verify the generated PDF by sharing a link or using a PDF viewer extension. In this case, I used the [PDF Viewer VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathematic.vscode-pdf) to view the file.
