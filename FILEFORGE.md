In today's digital world, managing documents efficiently is more important with evolving tools. Traditional PDF tools is not an important option when it comes to flexibility, design, and integration. Document management systems play a key role in everything from daily tasks to complex business operations.  This blog will guide you through the challenges of traditional document management tools and an alternative to that.

## Challenges of Traditional Documentation Management System

1. **Static Document Creation**:
   Old PDF tools often used fixed templates which makes it hard to add dynamic content like real-time data or personalized user information without complex coding.
2. **Limited Design Options**:
   Many PDF generators couldn’t easily create professional-looking documents that followed a company’s branding which makes it difficult to ensure a consistent look across different documents.
3. **Difficult Integration with Existing Systems**:
   Most PDF tools requires significant custom coding to integrate into existing software which increases development time and risk of errors.
4. **Scalability and Performance Issues**:
   As businesses grow, they need PDF tools that can keep up with larger demands. Many older solutions struggled when handling a large number of documents that leads to slow performance.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   With users accessing documents on different devices, it’s important for PDFs to look good on mobile and desktop. Older tools weren’t designed for this which leads to poor user experiences on mobile devices.

## Introducing FileForge

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d86263-5a98-4b3c-b9c1-91be4e7e0ccb)


FileForge is a powerful API designed to simplify working with PDF documents. Whether you need to create, fill out forms, add digital signatures, or manage complex document processes, FileForge offers everything you need in one place. It is also easy to integrate into modern web applications, thanks to its open-source React library called react-print.

## Creating PDF using FileForge

In this section I will be creating a PDF using FileForge by compiling a React component and also using taiwind in the code.

**Step 1**: **Creating a Account of FileForge**

To start using FileForge for PDF creation, you can visit their [docs](https://docs.fileforge.com/getting-started/general/welcome) section to look at all the available options. Also do create an account on [FileForge](https://app.fileforge.com/) to start using their API offerings.

**Step 2**: **Choosing the Project**

You can either use FileForge in exisiting codebase to perform all the available operations or you can also write the code for converting or creating few documents from scratch. In this scenario I will be using the below configuration to create a PDF.

```
import React from "react";
import "dotenv/config";
import fs from "fs";
import { FileforgeClient } from '@fileforge/client';
import { compile, Tailwind, Footnote } from "@fileforge/react-print";

const Document = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Tailwind>
        <main className="text-gray-700">
          <h1 className="text-4xl text-gray-800">Hey {name}!</h1>
          <img
            className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
            src="wemakedevs.png"
            alt="WeMakeDevs-Image"
          />
          <p className="my-8">
            This is a PDF to demonstrate the working of FileForge
            <Footnote>Do checkout the website for more such conversions.</Footnote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick links:
            <ul className="my-4 mx-4">
              <li>
                <a
                  className="text-blue-500 underline"
                  href="https://docs.fileforge.com"
                >
                  Documentation
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  className="text-blue-500 underline"
                  href="https://docs.fileforge.com/react-print/welcome/getting-started"
                >
                  React-print-pdf: FileForge open-source library to design PDFs with React
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </main>
      </Tailwind>
    </>
  );
};

const ff = new FileforgeClient({
  apiKey: process.env.FILEFORGE_API_KEY,
});

(async () => {
  try {
    const HTML = await compile(<Document name="Folks" />);

    const pdf = await ff.pdf.generate(
      [new File([HTML], "index.html", {
        type: "text/html",
      }),
       new File([fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/images/wemakedevs.png")], "wemakedevs.png", {
        type: "image/png",  
       })
    ],
      {
        options: {
          host: false,
          test: false,
        },
      }
    );

    pdf.pipe(fs.createWriteStream("WeMakeDevs-FileForge.pdf"));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during PDF conversion:", error);
  }
})();

```

**Step 3**: **Creating and Rendering the PDF**

Once you have the configuration ready you can use the below command to create and render the PDF.

```
npm run render 
```
Make sure to provide the path of file contaning above configuration in render section of `package.json` file of a particluar project.

**Step 4**: **Verifying the Content and PDF**

There are several ways to do this, you can either create a shareable link or install PDF viewer extension to look at the changes made.

In this scenario I have [PDF Viewer VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathematic.vscode-pdf) installed to view the PDF file generated.
