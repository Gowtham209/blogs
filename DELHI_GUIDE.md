### Dilli Hai Dilwalon Ki  
(Translation: "Delhi is for the warm-hearted")

_A Delhi guide by [Kunal Kushwaha](https://x.com/kunalstwt) from [Civo](https://www.civo.com)._

The capital city of India, Delhi, has roots that trace back thousands of years. Known as Indraprastha in ancient texts dating as far back as 400 BCE, it has been the center of various cultures and empires. There's always something happening in Delhi, with a wide array of activities to experience. In this guide, I'll share how you can make the most of your time when you visit during KubeCon India in December.

### Weather

In December, Delhi will be chilly with temperatures ranging from 22°C during the day to as low as 5°C at night. Pack a jacket and warm clothes. Rain is unlikely during this time, but it’s best to check the weather forecast closer to your travel date.

### Transportation

- **Uber**: Uber is affordable, and you can pay by card. However, some drivers may ask you to cancel rides and pay them in cash. Avoid this by insisting on paying through the app to prevent being overcharged or scammed.
  
- **Auto Rickshaws**: Another common form of transport. Compare the price offered by the rickshaw driver to what Uber suggests, as rickshaws only take cash unless booked via Uber.

- **Delhi Metro**: An efficient and affordable way to get around the city, with extensive coverage across Delhi and surrounding areas. It's clean, reliable, and a great option to avoid traffic.

### Food and Shopping

1. **Local Shopping**: Vendors are everywhere in Delhi, and it’s wise to go with a local friend to avoid being overcharged. Lajpat Nagar is a great place for local shopping, but for fair prices and quality, I recommend sticking to malls. However, the hustle and bustle of Lajpat Nagar is worth experiencing, especially for delicious street food.

2. **Malls**: Malls are a reliable way to shop for authentic Indian goods and enjoy good food:
   - Ambience Mall, Gurgaon: Near the conference venue, it offers a wide range of shopping, food, and activities.
   - DLF Mall of India, Noida: India’s largest mall and my personal favorite for food and shopping.
   - Select Citywalk, Saket: Popular for nightlife and shopping. The DLF mall next door is excellent for restaurants.

3. **Street Food**: While Delhi is famous for street food, it can be a hit or miss in terms of hygiene. I recommend sticking to trusted chains like Haldiram’s or Bikanervala for safe, authentic street food and sweets. Lajpat Nagar, Nehru Place, and Connaught Place also have good street food options if you're feeling adventurous.

4. **32nd Milestone, Gurgaon**: A lively area with a variety of restaurants and bars, offering a great mix of cuisines and a vibrant atmosphere. It's close to the conference venue and perfect for an evening out.

### Things to Do in Delhi

1. **India Gate**: A monumental war memorial built in honor of Indian soldiers, surrounded by beautiful lawns, making it a great spot for a peaceful evening stroll.
2. **Lotus Temple**: Known for its stunning flower-like shape, this temple is a peaceful place for meditation.
3. **Akshardham Temple**: A stunning modern temple complex showcasing India's rich cultural heritage through intricate architecture, gardens, and a beautiful water show. It's a must-visit for its grandeur and serenity.
4. **Red Fort**: A grand fortress from the Mughal era, offering a peek into Delhi’s historical significance. Though historically significant, Chandni Chowk can be very crowded, with a high risk of pickpocketing. The area is often dirty, and there's not much to do beyond the local market. I recommend skipping it unless you have a specific reason to visit.

5. **National Museum**: A treasure trove of India's art, history, and culture spanning millennia.
6. **Dilli Haat**: A market with traditional handicrafts and foods from various Indian states. A must-visit for authentic Indian souvenirs.

### Nightlife

1. **Connaught Place (CP)**: The best area for nightlife, filled with bars and restaurants, and safe with regular police patrols. It’s also close to many embassies, ensuring a professional and secure environment.
  
2. **DLF CyberHub**: Located near the conference venue, CyberHub in Gurgaon is a great spot with numerous offices, restaurants, and bars. Clean and modern, it offers a variety of dining and entertainment options.

3. **Hauz Khas Social**: Popular but tends to attract a younger crowd. If you're looking for a more professional vibe, stick to CP or CyberHub.

- **Pollution**: December is known for Delhi’s pollution, so it’s advisable to bring face masks for protection. 
  
- **Safety**: Delhi is generally a safe city, especially if you're with others. Personally, I feel safer in Delhi than some other cities. Stick to the places I’ve recommended or ask trusted locals for advice. Avoid poorly lit alleys, particularly at night, and it’s always best to travel with someone.
